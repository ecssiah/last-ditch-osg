Last Ditch - Design Document

* Game Engine
** Setting
The planet has enormous skyscrapers with large abandoned sections that are now
filled with small settlements. The playable sections will be dwarfed by much
larger surrounding buildings. The planet had an advanced civilization that
built the buildings and left behind all kinds of machinery. The settlements
do not have the knowledge to repair the ruins, and instead live a much more
primitive life of salvaging.
** Gameplay
The player attempts to build and manage a settlement in the world. This is
done by influencing NPCs to join the settlement to provide resources and
useful abilities and then managing them when they join. The player will
also be able to individually contribute to the settlement based on their
class.
*** Notes
- no stairs, small elevators.
- elevators will be activated by touching a patch on the left side of the
character's chest.
** Characters
*** Kadijah
The main character. A refugee from a collapsed settlement on another
part of the planet.
*** Katharine
Kadijah's best friend. She introduces Kadijah to life in the ruins.
She's the only permanent member of the settlement. She will never
abandon for morale or alignment issues.

*** Inventory
The player's inventory has volume and weight restrictions. Volume
restrictions are enforced by a grid system and differently sized item
icons. Weight restrictions are enforced by a maximum weight limit and
stages of encumberance.
** Settlements
The main drive of the game is to develop the settlement. The settlement will be
under constant stress from surrounding settlements. Some of the more agreeable
settlements and "free agents" are also a source of economic interaction.
Settlements can join together or individuals can change allegiance with potential
consequences.
*** Members
The settlement will always have at least two members (Kadijah and Katharine).
But others can be enlisted by influencing them with resources, reputation, and
skills. Members can choose to leave or shirk their duties due to a number of
factors like their satisfaction with the settlement or competing interests.
*** Laws
Settlements can establish laws and regulations to be enforced. These can include
agreements with other settlements about territory or taxation laws.
*** Positions
The settlement is partially managed by assigning your members positions that
come with a set of responsibilities. The positions are entirely customizable.
A position is simply a title with a list of responsibilities. Various things
will affect how well a member carries out their responsibilities.
*** Worksites
For members to perform most of their duties the related worksite needs to be
set up. Through the combination of worksites and positions, the player can
manage the intended workflow of the settlement's members.
*** Territory
A settlement will have a series of buildings, areas, and objects considered to be
their property. Depending on how secure the settlement is, violations of
property will result in consequences. Violations can range from destruction
of property to trespassing based on the agreements in place between
settlements.
** Combat
Combat is realtime and tick-based. Actions are placed into a queue and then
executed based on character stats. The use of personal field-generating shields
has lead to the increased usefulness of hand-to-hand combat. With a strong
shield, a well-trained individual can get in close and do significant damage,
even in a ranged weapon fight.
** Trading
For a settlement to really grow it will have to establish trade. Other settlements
will desire resources and products and they will also attempt to establish trade
with the player. No single settlement will be able to produce the variety of goods
needed to grow.
*** Black Market
Some settlements will outlaw certain goods or put limits on trade. Providing these
resources will lead to criminal conduct, but also higher profits since the goods
will be harder to produce. If other settlements produce and funnel contraband goods
into your settlement, it will reduce morale among a percentage of the members.
** Production
The crafting system involves gathering/producing the necessary ingredients and then
using a number of skills to construct something. The quality of the construction is
determined by the outcome of the very quick "mini-games".
